# Password Manager App
This is a project I have done while I take Udemy Course from Angela Yu.
This idea is not my original idea but I write my own codes.

## How App looks like

## How it works
It basically take data from user (website, email and password) also generate random password if you decided to click on the button and when you click to add button it automatically
save the data to a .json file. 
You can also use it to search through saved data with writing the website name and clicking search button.
